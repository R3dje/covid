# covid-19

This repo serves two goals:

* The Jupyter notebook covid-data.ipynb can be run to visualize the COVID-19 pandemia across different countries, with correction per capita etc.
* The countries.csv file consists of population size and land area data that are fed into an interactive dashboard that can be consulted at: http://rr-dash-app.herokuapp.com/
